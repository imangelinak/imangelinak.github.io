***GET TO KNOW ME***

Hi there! My name is Angelina Katrandzhiyska. I was born and raised in Bulgaria (Eastern Europe). Currently, I'm persuing and finishing up a Masters in Information Technologies with a Minor in Data Analysis. I also graduated a Bachelors of Business Administration and Management in the US. I'm a data scientist with a passion for turning data into actionable insights. With a strong foundation in Python, I specialize in building and applying machine learning algorithms to solve real-world problems and making day-today life easier. My work often involves data visualization, helping teams and stakeholders see the story behind the numbers, and creating clear, impactful data reports that drive decision-making. My puprose in Data Science is not to use tools but to build visualizations and data programs through coding in VS code. This, combined with generating reports and turning them into articles completes the cycle of the combination between development and data analysis. 

I enjoy exploring the latest in data science tools, experimenting with new models, and sharing practical knowledge that helps others grow in the field. Whether it’s a deep-dive into model performance or tips on cleaner visualizations, this blog is my space to share lessons, experiments, and insights from the world of data.

When I'm not working with data, you'll probably find me swimming, drawing, or enjoying a good board game with friends. I believe that creativity and curiosity—both in work and play—are key to solving tough problems.

Thanks for stopping by—I hope you find something useful here!
